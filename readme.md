# What is it ?

This is the list of all available audio TEDTalks. It is intended for
tech-oriented people who would like to use it in their own scripts (eg.
`wget`).

## Why ?

Because I like to listen to TEDTalks and needed a way to easily download them
on put them on my media player. I wrote a bunch of scripts to that end, and
decided to share it.

## Usage

Feel free to use any of the files of this repo in your own scripts.

## How is it built ?

It started with manual parsing of CSV and XML files, and later used the TED
API. It now is a mix of API and RSS parsing.
