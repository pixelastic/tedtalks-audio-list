# TEDSearch

This repository was initially a personal script I had to download the full list
of TEDTalks as `mp3` files to listen while I was on the go.

It served me well, and then TED decided to shut their API down, preventing me
from running the script again to get the latest files.

I then decided to give a second life to this project by rewriting the scripts to
scrap the website instead of using the API and rebuilding the list of metadata
from here.

I'll also add a search UI on top of it.

## TODO

Get the TEDxTalks as well: http://tedxtalks.ted.com/sitemap.xml
