  "description": "Civilians don’t miss war. But soldiers often do. Journalist Sebastian Junger shares his experience embedded with American soldiers at Restrepo, an outpost in Afghanistan's Korengal Valley that saw heavy combat. Giving a look at the \"altered state of mind\" that comes with war, he shows how combat gives soldiers an intense experience of connection. In the end, could it actually be \"the opposite of war\" that soldiers miss? ",
