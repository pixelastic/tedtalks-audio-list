  "description": "More and more, nations are waging attacks with cyber weapons -- silent strikes on another country's computer systems that leave behind no trace. (Think of the Stuxnet worm.) Guy-Philippe Goldstein shows how cyberattacks can leap between the digital and physical worlds to prompt armed conflict -- and how we might avert this global security hazard.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/391>TEDxParis</a>.)</em>",
