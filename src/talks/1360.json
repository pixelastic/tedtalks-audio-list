  "description": "They're the second largest fish in the world, they're almost extinct, and we know almost nothing about them. In this talk, Simon Berrow describes the fascinating basking shark (\"Great Fish of the Sun\" in Irish), and the exceptional -- and wonderfully low-tech -- ways he's learning enough to save them.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/4105>TEDxDublin</a>.)</em>",
