  "description": "An average teaspoon of ocean water contains five million bacteria and fifty million viruses â€“ and yet we are just starting to discover how these \"invisible engineers\" control our ocean's chemistry. At TEDxMonterey, Melissa Garren sheds light on marine microbes that provide half the oxygen we breathe, maintain underwater ecosystems, and demonstrate surprising hunting skills. (Apologies for the small audio glitches in this video.)\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/4085>TEDxMonterey</a>.)</em>\r\n",
