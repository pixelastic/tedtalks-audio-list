  "description": "As you surf the Web, information is being collected about you. Web tracking is not 100% evil -- personal data can make your browsing more efficient; cookies can help your favorite websites stay in business. But, says Gary Kovacs, it's your right to know what data is being collected about you. He unveils a Firefox add-on, Collusion, to do just that. (Update: Collusion is now called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/\" target=\"_blank\">Lightbeam</a>.)",
