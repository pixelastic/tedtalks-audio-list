  "description": "When hundreds of thousands of tweets are fired every second, a one-in-a-million chance -- including unlikely-sounding scenarios that could harm users -- happens about 500 times a day. For Del Harvey, who heads Twitter’s Trust and Safety Team, these odds aren’t good. The security maven spends her days thinking about how to prevent worst-case scenarios while giving voice to people around the globe. With deadpan humor, she offers a window into how she keeps 240 million users safe.",
