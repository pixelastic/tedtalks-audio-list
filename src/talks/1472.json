  "description": "Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected, but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict. At TEDxPeachtree, Ami Klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-tracking technologies to gauge babies' social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/1796>TEDxPeachTree</a>.)</em>\r\n",
