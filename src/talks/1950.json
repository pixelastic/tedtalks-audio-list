  "description": "Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it. \"Your rights matter,” he says, \"because you never know when you're going to need them.\" Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee.",
