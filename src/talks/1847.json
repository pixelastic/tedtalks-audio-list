  "description": "Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days, too. Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why, for the loved ones of the dying, having hope for a happy ending shouldn't warrant a diagnosis of \"denial.\" She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life.",
