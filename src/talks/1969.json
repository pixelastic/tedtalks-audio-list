  "description": "We live in a world of unseeable beauty, so subtle and delicate that it is imperceptible to the human eye. To bring this invisible world to light, filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg bends the boundaries of time and space with high-speed cameras, time lapses and microscopes. At TED2014, he shares highlights from his latest project, a 3D film titled \"Mysteries of the Unseen World,\" which slows down, speeds up, and magnifies the astonishing wonders of nature.",
