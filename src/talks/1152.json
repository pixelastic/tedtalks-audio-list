  "description": "Artist Aaron Koblin takes vast amounts of data -- and at times vast numbers of people -- and weaves them into stunning visualizations. From elegant lines tracing airline flights to landscapes of cell phone data, from a Johnny Cash video assembled from crowd-sourced drawings to the \"Wilderness Downtown\" video that customizes for the user, his works brilliantly explore how modern technology can make us more human.",
