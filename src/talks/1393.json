  "description": "Architecture can bring people together, or divide them -- witness the skyscraper, costly, inefficient, and only serving small portions of the community. At TEDxPortofSpain, Mark Raymond encourages city governments to let go of their old notions of success and consider the balance of environment, economy, and society to design cities for social change. \r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/2038> TEDxPortofSpain</a>.)</em>",
