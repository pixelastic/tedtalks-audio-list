  "description": "In this well-argued talk, Timothy Bartik makes the macro-economic case for preschool education -- and explains why you should be happy to invest in it, even if you don't have kids that age (or kids at all). The economic benefits of well-educated kids, it turns out, go well beyond the altruistic. (Filmed at <a href=\"http://www.units.muohio.edu/tedx/home\">TEDxMiamiUniversity</a>.)",
