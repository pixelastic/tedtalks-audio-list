  "description": "The subject of race can be very touchy.  As finance executive Mellody Hobson says, it's a \"conversational third rail.\" But, she says, that's exactly why we need to start talking about it. In this engaging, persuasive talk, Hobson makes the case that speaking openly about race â€” and particularly about diversity in hiring -- makes for better businesses and a better society.",
