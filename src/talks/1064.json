  "description": "Architect Kate Orff sees the oyster as an agent of urban change. Bundled into beds and sunk into city rivers, oysters slurp up pollution and make legendarily dirty waters clean -- thus driving even more innovation in \"oyster-tecture.\" Orff shares her vision for an urban landscape that links nature and humanity for mutual benefit.",
