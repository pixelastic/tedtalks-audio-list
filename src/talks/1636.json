  "description": "When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent, Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message: \"Iranians ... we [heart] you.\" Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and Iranians responded in kind. The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like \"Israel loves Iran,\" \"Iran loves Israel\" and even \"Palestine loves Israel.\"",
