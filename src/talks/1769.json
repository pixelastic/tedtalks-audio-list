  "description": "In 1985, architect Paul Pholeros was challenged by the director of an Aboriginal-controlled health service to \"stop people getting sick\" in a small indigenous community in south Australia. The key insights: think beyond medicine and fix the local environment. In this sparky, interactive talk, Pholeros describes projects undertaken by Healthabitat, the organization he now runs to help reduce poverty--through practical design fixes--in Australia and beyond. <em>(Filmed at TEDxSydney.)</em>",
