  "description": "SETI researcher Seth Shostak bets that we will find extraterrestrial life in the next twenty-four years, or he'll buy you a cup of coffee. At TEDxSanJoseCA, he explains why new technologies and the laws of probability make the breakthrough so likely -- and forecasts how the discovery of civilizations far more advanced than ours might affect us here on Earth.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/3642>TEDxSanJoseCA</a>.)</em>",
