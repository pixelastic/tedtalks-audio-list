  "description": "The gastric brooding frog lays its eggs just like any other frog -- then swallows them whole to incubate. That is, it did until it went extinct 30 years ago. Paleontologist Michael Archer makes a case to bring back the gastric brooding frog and the thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger. <em>(Filmed at <a href=\"http://tedxdeextinction.org\" target=\"_blank\">TEDxDeExtinction</a>.)</em> ",
