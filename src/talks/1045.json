  "description": "Lesley Hazleton sat down one day to read the Koran. And what she found -- as a non-Muslim, a self-identified \"tourist\" in the Islamic holy book -- wasn't what she expected. With serious scholarship and warm humor, Hazleton shares the grace, flexibility and mystery she found, in this myth-debunking talk.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/298>TEDxRainier</a>.)</em>\r\n",
