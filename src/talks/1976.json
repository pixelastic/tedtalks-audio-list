  "description": "Astronomers believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet, one fifth of which might harbor life. Only we haven't seen any of them -- yet. Jeremy Kasdin and his team are looking to change that with the design and engineering of an extraordinary piece of equipment: a flower petal-shaped \"starshade\" positioned 50,000 km from a telescope to enable imaging of planets about distant stars. It is, he says, the \"coolest possible science.\"",
