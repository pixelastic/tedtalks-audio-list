  "description": "Vending machines generally offer up sodas, candy bars and chips. Not so for the one created by TED Fellow Gabe Barcia-Colombo. This artist has dreamed up a DNA Vending Machine, which dispenses extracted human DNA, packaged in a vial along with a collectible photo of the person who gave it. Itâ€™s charming and quirky, but points out larger ethical issues that will arise as access to biotechnology increases.",
