  "description": "Luke Syson was a curator of Renaissance art, of transcendent paintings of saints and solemn Italian ladies -- <em>serious</em> art. And then he changed jobs, and inherited the Met's collection of ceramics -- pretty, frilly, \"useless\" candlesticks and vases. He didn't like it. He didn't get it. Until one day â€¦ <em>(Filmed at TEDxMet.)</em>",
