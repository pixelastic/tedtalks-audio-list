  "description": "In 1991, Shaka Senghor shot and killed a man. He was, he says, \"a drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi-automatic pistol.\" Jailed for second degree murder, that could very well have been the end of the story. But it wasn't. Instead, it was the beginning of a years-long journey to redemption, one with humbling and sobering lessons for us all.",
