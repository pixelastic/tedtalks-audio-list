  "description": "Astronomer Dimitar Sasselov and his colleagues search for Earth-like planets that may, someday, help us answer centuries-old questions about the origin and existence of biological life elsewhere (and on Earth). Preliminary results show that they have found 706 \"candidates\" -- some of which further research may prove to be planets with Earth-like geochemical characteristics.",
