  "description": "In her talk, longtime English teacher Patricia Ryan asks a provocative question: Is the world's focus on English preventing the spread of great ideas in other languages? (For instance: what if Einstein had to pass the TOEFL?) It's a passionate defense of translating and sharing ideas.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/1315>TEDxDubai</a>.)</em>",
