  "description": "\"If I should have a daughter, instead of Mom, she's gonna call me Point B ... \" began spoken word poet Sarah Kay, in a talk that inspired two standing ovations at TED2011. She tells the story of her metamorphosis -- from a wide-eyed teenager soaking in verse at New York's Bowery Poetry Club to a teacher connecting kids with the power of self-expression through Project V.O.I.C.E. -- and gives two breathtaking performances of \"B\" and \"Hiroshima.\"",
