  "description": "Born three and a half months prematurely, Derek Paravicini is blind and has severe autism. But with perfect pitch, innate talent and a lot of practice, he became an acclaimed concert pianist by the age of 10. Here, his longtime piano teacher, Adam Ockelford, explains his studentâ€™s unique relationship to music, while Paravicini shows how he has ripped up the \"Chopsticks\" rule book. (<em>Filmed at TEDxWarwick.</em>)",
