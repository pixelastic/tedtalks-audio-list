  "description": "In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal, Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace, and asks: How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core, rather than control? She believes the internet is headed for a \"Magna Carta\" moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection.",
