  "description": "Using robotics, laser rangefinders, GPS and smart feedback tools, Dennis Hong is building a car for drivers who are blind. It's not a \"self-driving\" car, he's careful to note, but a car in which a non-sighted driver can determine speed, proximity and route -- and drive independently.",
