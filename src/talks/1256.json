  "description": "How does cancer know it's cancer? At Jay Bradner's lab, they found a molecule that might hold the answer, JQ1 -- and instead of patenting JQ1, they published their findings and mailed samples to 40 other labs to work on. An inspiring look at the open-source future of medical research.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/1345>TEDxBoston</a>.)</em>",
