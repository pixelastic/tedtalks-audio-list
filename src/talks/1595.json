  "description": "The public is losing faith in democracy, says British MP Rory Stewart. Iraq and Afghanistanâ€™s new democracies are deeply corrupt; meanwhile, 84 percent of people in Britain say politics is broken. In this important talk, Stewart sounds a call to action to rebuild democracy, starting with recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a tool, but as an ideal.",
