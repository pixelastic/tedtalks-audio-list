  "description": "Van Jones lays out a case against plastic pollution from the perspective of social justice. Because plastic trash, he shows us, hits poor people and poor countries \"first and worst,\" with consequences we all share no matter where we live and what we earn. In this powerful talk, he offers a few powerful ideas to help us reclaim our throwaway planet.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/1192>TEDxGPGP</a>.)</em>\r\n",
