  "description": "Temple Grandin, diagnosed with autism as a child, talks about how her mind works -- sharing her ability to \"think in pictures,\" which helps her solve problems that neurotypical brains might miss. She makes the case that the world needs people on the autism spectrum: visual thinkers, pattern thinkers, verbal thinkers, and all kinds of smart geeky kids.",
