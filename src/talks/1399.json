  "description": "We can’t control if we’ll die, but we can “occupy death,” in the words of Peter Saul, an emergency doctor. He asks us to think about the end of our lives -- and to question against the modern model of slow, intubated death in hospital. Two big questions can you help start this tough conversation.",
