  "description": "Every doctor makes mistakes. But, says physician Brian Goldman, medicine's culture of denial (and shame) keeps doctors from ever talking about those mistakes, or using them to learn and improve. Telling stories from his own long practice, he calls on doctors to start talking about being wrong.\r\n\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/2937>TEDxToronto</a>.)</em>",
