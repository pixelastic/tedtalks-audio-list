  "description": "In politics, it seems counterintuitive to engage in dialogue with violent groups, with radicals and terrorists, and with the states that support them. But Jonas Gahr Støre, the foreign minister of Norway, makes a compelling case for open discussion, even when values diverge, in an attempt to build greater security for all.\r\n\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/2400>TEDxRC2</a>.)</em>",
