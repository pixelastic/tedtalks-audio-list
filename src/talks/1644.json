  "description": "When Jarrett J. Krosoczka was a kid, he didn’t play sports, but he <em>loved</em> art. He paints the funny and touching story of a little boy who pursued a simple passion: to draw and write stories. With the help of a supporting cast of family and teachers, our protagonist grew up to become the successful creator of beloved children’s book characters, and a vocal advocate for arts education. <em>(Filmed at TEDxHampshireCollege.)</em>",
