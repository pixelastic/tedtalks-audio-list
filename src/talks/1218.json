  "description": "Before life existed on Earth, there was just matter, inorganic dead \"stuff.\" How improbable is it that life arose? And -- could it use a different type of chemistry? Using an elegant definition of life (anything that can evolve), chemist Lee Cronin is exploring this question by attempting to create a fully inorganic cell using a \"Lego kit\" of inorganic molecules -- no carbon -- that can assemble, replicate and compete.",
