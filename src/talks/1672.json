  "description": "Kakenya Ntaiya made a deal with her father: She would undergo the traditional Maasai rite of passage of female circumcision if he would let her go to high school. Ntaiya tells the fearless story of continuing on to college, and of working with her village elders to build a school for girls in her community. Itâ€™s the educational journey of one that altered the destiny of 125 young women. (<em>Filmed at TEDxMidAtlantic.</em>)",
