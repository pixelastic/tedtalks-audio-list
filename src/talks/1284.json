  "description": "Britta Riley wanted to grow her own food (in her tiny apartment). So she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in discarded plastic bottles -- researching, testing and tweaking the system using social media, trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system. Call it distributed DIY. And the results? Delicious.\r\n<em>(Filmed at <a href=http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/744>TEDxManhattan </a>.)</em>",
