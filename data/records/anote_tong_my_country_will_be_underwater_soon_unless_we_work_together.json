  "description": "For the people of Kiribati, climate change isn't something to be debated, denied or legislated against -- it's an everyday reality. The low-lying Pacific island nation may soon be underwater, thanks to rising sea levels. In a personal conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Kiribati President Anote Tong discusses his country's present climate catastrophe and its imperiled future. \"In order to deal with climate change, there's got to be sacrifice. There's got to be commitment,\" he says. \"We've got to tell people that the world has changed.\"",
