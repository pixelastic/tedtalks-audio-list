  "description": "Within each of us are two selves, suggests David Brooks in this meditative short talk: the self who craves success, who builds a résumé, and the self who seeks connection, community, love -- the values that make for a great eulogy. (Joseph Soloveitchik has called these selves \"Adam I\" and \"Adam II.\") Brooks asks: Can we balance these two selves?",
