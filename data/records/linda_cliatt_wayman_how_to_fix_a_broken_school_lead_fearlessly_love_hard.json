  "description": "On Linda Cliatt-Wayman's first day as principal at a failing high school in North Philadelphia, she was determined to lay down the law. But she soon realized the job was more complex than she thought. With palpable passion, she shares the three principles that helped her turn around three schools labeled \"low-performing and persistently dangerous.\" Her fearless determination to lead -- and to love the students, no matter what -- is a model for leaders in all fields.",
