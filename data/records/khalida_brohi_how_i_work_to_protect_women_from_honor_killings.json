  "description": "Nearly 1000 \"honor\" killings are reported in Pakistan each year, murders by a family member for behavior deemed \"shameful,\" such as a relationship outside of marriage. When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists.",
