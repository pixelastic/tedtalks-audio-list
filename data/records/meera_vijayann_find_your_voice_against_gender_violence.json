  "description": "This talk begins with a personal story of sexual violence that may be difficult to listen to. But thatâ€™s the point, says citizen journalist Meera Vijayann: Speaking out on tough, taboo topics is the spark for change. Vijayann uses digital media to speak honestly about her experience of gender violence in her home country of India -- and calls on others to speak out too.\r\n",
