  "description": "Vincent Moon travels the world with a backpack and a camera, filming astonishing music and ritual the world rarely sees -- from a powerful Sufi ritual in Chechnya to an ayahuasca journey in Peru. He hopes his films can help people see their own cultures in a new way, to make young people say: \"Whoa, my grandfather is as cool as Beyoncé.\" Followed by a mesmerizing performance by jazz icon Naná Vasconcelos.",
