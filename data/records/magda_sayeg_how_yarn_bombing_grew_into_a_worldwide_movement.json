  "description": "Textile artist Magda Sayeg transforms urban landscapes into her own playground by decorating everyday objects with colorful knit and crochet works. These warm, fuzzy \"yarn bombs\" started small, with stop sign poles and fire hydrants in Sayeg's hometown, but soon people found a connection to the craft and spread it across the world. \"We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable,\" Sayeg says. \"Hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.\"",
