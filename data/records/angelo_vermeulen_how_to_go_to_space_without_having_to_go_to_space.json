  "description": "\"We will start inhabiting outer space,\" says Angelo Vermeulen, crew commander of a NASA-funded Mars simulation. \"It might take 50 years or it might take 500 years, but itâ€™s going to happen.\" In this charming talk, the TED Senior Fellow describes some of his official work to make sure humans are prepared for life in deep space ... and shares a fascinating art project in which he challenged people worldwide to design homes we might live in there.",
