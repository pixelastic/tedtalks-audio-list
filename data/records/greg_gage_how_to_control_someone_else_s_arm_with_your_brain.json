  "description": "Greg Gage is on a mission to make brain science accessible to all. In this fun, kind of creepy demo, the neuroscientist and TED Senior Fellow uses a simple, inexpensive DIY kit to take away the free will of an audience member. Itâ€™s not a parlor trick; it actually works. You have to see it to believe it.",
