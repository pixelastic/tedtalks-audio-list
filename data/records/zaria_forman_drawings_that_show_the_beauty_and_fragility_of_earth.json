  "description": "Zaria Forman's large-scale compositions of melting glaciers, icebergs floating in glassy water and waves cresting with foam explore moments of transition, turbulence and tranquility. Join her as she discusses the meditative process of artistic creation and the motivation behind her work. \"My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose,\" she says. \"I hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux.\"",
