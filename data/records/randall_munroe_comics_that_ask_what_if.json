  "description": "Web cartoonist Randall Munroe answers simple what-if questions (\"what if you hit a baseball moving at the speed of light?\") using math, physics, logic and deadpan humor. In this charming talk, a reader’s question about Google's data warehouse leads Munroe down a circuitous path to a hilariously over-detailed answer — in which, shhh, you might actually learn something.",
