  "description": "Sebastian Junger has seen war up close, and he knows the impact that battlefield trauma has on soldiers. But he suggests there's another major cause of pain for veterans when they come home: the experience of leaving the tribal closeness of the military and returning to an alienating and bitterly divided modern society. \"Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets,\" Junger says. \"I think the real question is if we can save ourselves.\" (This talk comes from the PBS special \"TED Talks: War & Peace,\" which premieres Monday, May 30 at 9 p.m. EST.)",
