  "description": "When artist Salvatore Iaconesi was diagnosed with brain cancer, he refused to be a passive patient -- which, he points out, means \"one who waits.\" So he hacked his brain scans, posted them online, and invited a global community to pitch in on a \"cure.\" This sometimes meant medical advice, and it sometimes meant art, music, emotional support -- from more than half a million people.",
