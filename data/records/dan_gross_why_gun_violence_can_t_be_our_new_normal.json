  "description": "It doesn't matter whether you love or hate guns; it's obvious that the US would be a safer place if there weren't thousands of them sold every day without background checks. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, makes a passionate, personal appeal for something that more than 90 percent of Americans want: background checks for all gun sales. \"For every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, 'That's when things really started to change,'\" Gross says. \"For the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here.\"",
