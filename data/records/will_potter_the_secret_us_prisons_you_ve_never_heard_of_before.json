  "description": "Investigative journalist Will Potter is the only reporter who has been inside a Communications Management Unit, or CMU, within a US prison. These units were opened secretly, and radically alter how prisoners are treated -- even preventing them from hugging their children. Potter, a TED Fellow, shows us who is imprisoned here, and how the government is trying to keep them hidden. \"The message was clear,\" he says. \"Donâ€™t talk about this place.\" Find sources for this talk at  willpotter.com/cmu",
