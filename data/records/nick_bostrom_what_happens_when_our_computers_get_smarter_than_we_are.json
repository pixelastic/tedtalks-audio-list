  "description": "Artificial intelligence is getting smarter by leaps and bounds -- within this century, research suggests, a computer AI could be as \"smart\" as a human being. And then, says Nick Bostrom, it will overtake us: \"Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.\" A philosopher and technologist, Bostrom asks us to think hard about the world we're building right now, driven by thinking machines. Will our smart machines help to preserve humanity and our values -- or will they have values of their own?",
