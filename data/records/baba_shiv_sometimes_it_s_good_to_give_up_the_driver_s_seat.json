  "description": "Over the years, research has shown a counterintuitive fact about human nature: Sometimes, having too much choice makes us less happy.

Baba Shiv shares a fascinating study that measures why choice opens the door to doubt, and suggests that ceding control -- especially on life-or-death decisions -- may be the best thing for us. ",
