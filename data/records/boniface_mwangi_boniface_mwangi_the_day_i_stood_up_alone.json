  "description": "Photographer Boniface Mwangi wanted to protest against corruption in his home country of Kenya. So he made a plan: He and some friends would stand up and heckle during a public mass meeting. But when the moment came ... he stood alone. What happened next, he says, showed him who he truly was. As he says, \"There are two most powerful days in your life. The day you are born, and the day you discover why.\" Graphic images.",
