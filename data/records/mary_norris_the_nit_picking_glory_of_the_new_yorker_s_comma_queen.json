  "description": "\"Copy editing for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League Baseball team -- every little movement gets picked over by the critics,\" says Mary Norris, who has played the position for more than thirty years. In that time, she's gotten a reputation for sternness and for being a \"comma maniac,\" but this is unfounded, she says. Above all, her work is aimed at one thing: making authors look good. Explore The New Yorker's distinctive style with the person who knows it best in this charming talk.",
