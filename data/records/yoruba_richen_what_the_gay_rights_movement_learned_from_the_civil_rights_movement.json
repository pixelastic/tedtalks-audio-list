  "description": "As a member of both the African American and LGBT communities, filmmaker Yoruba Richen is fascinated with the overlaps and tensions between the gay rights and the civil rights movements. She explores how the two struggles intertwine and propel each other forward â€” and, in an unmissable argument, she dispels a myth about their points of conflict. A powerful reminder that we all have a stake in equality.",
