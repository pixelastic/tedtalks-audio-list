  "description": "To those who feel like they don't belong: there is beauty in being a misfit. Author Lidia Yuknavitch shares her own wayward journey in an intimate recollection of patchwork stories about loss, shame and the slow process of self-acceptance. \"Even at the moment of your failure, you are beautiful,\" she says. \"You don't know it yet, but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly. That's your beauty.\"",
