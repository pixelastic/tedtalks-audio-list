  "description": "When Jimmy Nelson traveled to Siberia to photograph the Chukchi people, elders told him: \"You cannot photograph us. You have to wait, you have to wait until you get to know us, you have to wait until you understand us.\" In this gorgeously photo-filled talk, join Nelson's quest to understand -- the world, other people, himself -- by making astonishing portraits of the world's vanishing tribes and cultures.",
