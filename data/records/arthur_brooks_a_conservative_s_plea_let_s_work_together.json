  "description": "Conservatives and liberals both believe that they alone are motivated by love while their opponents are motivated by hate. How can we solve problems with so much polarization? In this talk, social scientist Arthur Brooks shares ideas for what we can each do as individuals to break the gridlock. \"We might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under and turn it into a competition of ideas,\" he says.",
