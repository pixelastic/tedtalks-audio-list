  "description": "We're headed towards a global food crisis: Nearly 3 billion people depend on the ocean for food, and at our current rate we already take more fish from the ocean than it can naturally replace. In this fact-packed, eye-opening talk, entrepreneur and conservationist Mike Velings proposes a solution: Aquaculture, or fish farming. \"We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters,\" he says, echoing Jacques Cousteau. \"The day will come where people will demand farmed fish on their plates that's farmed well and farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less.\"",
